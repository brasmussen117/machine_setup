Some personally useful aliases, scripts, and miscellaneous setup for a new machine.

## Setup

To make my life easier, I make symlinks from the home dir to this repo—that way they can be sourced in zshrc without having to fix paths.
To create a symbolic link in the home directory that points to this repo, you can use the following command:

```bash
ln -s <path/to-repo> ~/foo_symlink
```

## Packages/Apps
